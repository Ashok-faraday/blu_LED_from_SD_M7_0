 - S32G-VNP-RDB2 referance board, compiling, IVT mirror and bootable SD card. -

This little packer shows the source code and IVT settings, as a result of the full 
procedure, explained in the doc. S32G-VNP-RDB2-SW- THIS IS THE DOC - START HERE.pdf 
for the S32G-VNP-RDB2 referance board. It takes a day to set up.

But first it is important to have a fully functional Windows machine (10 or Higher) 
with latest version of NXP S32 Design Studio with all S32G2xx tools. So stear with 
the doc. S32DS_Installation_Guide.pdf.

Note: follow descriptions very literally.
